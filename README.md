# 🍔 DIP392 - Burger Town

**Burger Town** is a digital restaurant website designed to enhance the dining experience in Riga, Latvia. By scanning a QR code placed on a restaurant table, customers can instantly access the menu, place orders, and receive live updates on their order status — all from their own device.
