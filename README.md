# 🍔 Team 7 DIP392 - Burger Town

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the project Burger Town — a modern digital restaurant ordering platform developed by Team 7 for the DIP392 final project.

---

## 🧩 Project Summary

Burger Town is a web-based restaurant ordering system that allows customers to access a digital menu, place orders, and receive real-time updates directly from their own devices. By scanning a QR code placed on their table, users are instantly directed to the restaurant’s website without needing to download any app.

The system is designed to:

* Replace traditional paper menus with a digital alternative

* Allow customers to browse items, customize orders, and submit them to the kitchen

* Improve order accuracy, speed, and customer experience

* Help restaurant staff manage and process orders more efficiently

Burger Town is optimized for mobile and tablet use, making it an ideal solution for modern, tech-friendly dining environments.
